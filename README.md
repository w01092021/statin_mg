Project title: Myasthenia gravis following statin therapy: evidence from target trial emulation and self-controlled case series study

Our study employed two study designs to investigate the association between statin use and myasthenia gravis (MG). For interpersonal comparison, we emulated a sequence of nested target trials (1, 2) to compare the risk of events between the patients who initiated statin therapy and those who did not. For intrapersonal comparison, we applied the self-control cases series (SCCS) (3) method to estimate the risk difference within the same individuals before and after statin initiation. The risk of events was also estimated in different time intervals following statin therapy (i.e., month 1, months 2-4, months 5-7, months 8-13, months 14-19, and months 20-25), in order to provide information on the appropriate monitoring period to inform the clinical practice. 

All analyses were performed in Stata/MP 17.0 and R version 4.1.1.
